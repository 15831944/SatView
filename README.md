# SatView™
Satellite Monitoring &amp; Control System for Microsoft® Windows® 10

SatView™ is an advanced 'Satellite Monitoring & Control System' (MCS) that has been developed by BINARY SPACE and was used many years by multiple ESA projects (e.g. for the geo-stationary telecommunications satellite called ARTEMIS) or other customers like EADS Astrium. Its main focus is to support mission operations by providing a rich set of features highly automating all involved processes required to control a satellite.
It is compliant with the CCSDS Packet Telemetry/Telecommand Standard (CCSDS 102.0-B-2 el al.) but can be adapted to other (older) standards by some coding effort. Futhermore, through the generic driver-based I/O interface, it can also be re-configured for the 'Assembly, Integration & Test' (AIT) and 'In-orbit Test' (IOT) life-cycle phases of a satellite.

Currently, Satview™ bases on Microsoft® Windows® 10 (Version 1511, OS Build 10586 and above) and is designed to depend solely on Microsoft® software. This ensures a fast and seamless upgrade process. As a consequence of this, it runs on any commercially available hardware hosting the above mentioned OS.

Interested hardware integrators as well as those already operating satellites in orbit are most welcome to join this project and to help migrating SatView™ to many more projects.
