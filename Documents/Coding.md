#### SatView™ Coding Guidelines<br />
Although SatView™ is built using a kernel-based approach, it's still quite a challenge to adopt it to a mission's needs.<br />
In most cases, there are three major areas which need customization:
- Database
- Data I/O
- Automation<br />

</p>

#####1. Database
Currently, SatView™ supports two database standards: SCOS-2000 (ESA) and ALTEL (L3 Communications).<br />
The document [SatView™ Database Standards](../Documents/SatView™ Database Standards.pdf) describes these standards in more detail and helps to evaluate which one fits the mission's needs best.<br />
Depending on the chosen database standard the associated software projects need to be selected: **SCOS-2000** & **Satellite (SCOS-2000)** or **ALTEL** & **Satellite (ALTEL)**.
